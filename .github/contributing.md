## Guidelines

### Link requirements

The site the link targets **MUST BE**:

- Related to Matter
- Written in English.

Self-promotion is frowned upon, so please consider seriously whether your
project meets the criteria before opening a pull request, otherwise, it may
be closed without being reviewed.

### Adding a new link

- **Make an individual pull request for each link suggestion.**
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Use the following format: `- [project-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`
  - Keep the description short and simple, but descriptive.
  - A description ends with a full stop/period `.`!
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure that your suggestion is positioned as the last item category.

### Adding a new section/category

New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.

- Ensure the section has a nice description.
- A description ends with a full stop/period `.`!
- Add the section to the table of contents.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Remove any trailing whitespace.

### Deleting a link

Typical reasons for deleting links:

- The item does no longer apply to or work with the latest Home Assistant.
- No updates / abandoned.
- Deprecated.
- In case of software: License missing.
- Dead link.
